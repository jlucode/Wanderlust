# About The Project

This web application allows travelers to plan their trips to the world's most popular destinations. There are a total of 60 cities across 6 continents. The application consists of widgets inclusive of things to do, current weather, most popular restaurants, optimal months to visit, hotel pricing & cheapest available flights.

Some widgets also have a redirect button, which allows the user to further customize their travel plans.
